### Why the Project is Useful ###
This application is a theory crafted idea turned into reality. We ventured to create an application with a similar user experience found in common transportation applications today.


The app also fulfilled a project assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. It provided us with the opportunity to work with the following technologies:
*React-Bootstrap
*MongoDB/mongoose
*React
*Express
*Express-router/axios
*Google maps API
*Context API

### Who Maintains and Contributes to the Project ###

The team members of CloudCarry (Dominique McLean, Nicholas Panagakis, Arno Kole, Gabrielle Umbach, and Zachary Peña) created the project.
