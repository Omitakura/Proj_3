### Why the Project is Useful ###
This application is a theory crafted idea turned into reality. We ventured to created an application with a similar user experience found in common transportation applications today.


The app also fulfilled a project assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. It provided us with the opportunity to work with the following technologies:
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node and Express web servers
* Express Handlebars
* Heroku for deployment
* Git version-control system
* Slack messaging platform
* ADD MORE TECH
